# Photography Showcase Website
## Built with HTML and CSS

I created this website as a way to showcase my personal photography work, as well as develop new skills in HTML and CSS.

### 2021-09-12:
* Created a "Designs" page
* Changed footer icons 
* TO-DO: Make Website responsive

* Grid layout fixed for media
* Footer bug fixed
* TO-DO: Add "hamburger" menu just for the sake of learning it, tbh website doesn't need it.
